# advent-of-code

This repo is used to store my solutions for the puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

I saw Dave from [YSAP](https://www.youtube.com/@yousuckatprogramming) do it in Bash and I tought to myself it might be a good idea to try it out and see if I would be able to solve them.

I am going to try and complete these puzzles and, to make it more difficult for myself, I will try and do it in Rust to try and learn the language a bit.
